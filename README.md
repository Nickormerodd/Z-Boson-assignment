# Z-Boson-assignment
Minimisation of two variables with a chi squared matrix...

This code takes energy and cross sectional data for Z Bosons in the LHC, deletes any nans
or unacceptable,invalid and anomolous values (to a 3 sigma limit), and creates
useful plots, as well as telling the user what the reduced chi squared is by
minimising two parameters in a function and giving those values.
